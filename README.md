The security system consists of two features

- Face Recognition (The software firstly tries to detect the user's face for verification)
- Password (If the user authentication fails then the user needs to enter the correct password to get access and use it)

After the security system is cracked, the user can access the program by giving any of the commands according to the above mentioned features and the task is performed automatically.

Before running the program, set your face for verification. Follow the below steps:

- Run sample generator.py file, which collects the sample images for verification and stores in the samples folder.
- Now, run Model Trainer.py file, which trains the collected sample and creates a training file in trainer folder.
- And finally you are done setting up your face as a password. 

Follow the below steps to run the Carlin program:   

- Install all the required packages present in the requirements.txt file.
- Run the script.py file.
- To start the project say "Wake up" or "hey carlin".
- Then, verify by face or password and give commands.
- To exit the project, say "Sleep" or "you need a break".

The project will again get started by a command "Wake up" or "hey carlin".
For input commands, refer the sample.py file.
